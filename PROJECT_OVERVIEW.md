## System Architecture

**Frontend (React 18 + Vite)** — Component-based UI with Framer Motion animations, Context API state management, real-time job polling, and responsive Tailwind CSS design.

**Backend (FastAPI)** — REST API organized by feature (auth, users, wardrobe, try-on, recommendations, payments, admin). Service layer handles business logic, middleware manages CORS/logging, and background tasks clean up files.

**Database (MongoDB)** — Collections for users, wardrobe, jobs, recommendations, and subscriptions. Indexed queries, soft-delete support, and automatic timestamps for performance and auditability.

**AI Processing** — VTON model integration with configurable parameters (timesteps, guidance scale, segmentation). GPU acceleration via CUDA and local weight caching.

**Storage** — Local media directories organized by user and content type. Automatic image optimization and cleanup of files older than 24 hours.

### Communication Flow
- Frontend → Backend: REST API requests with JWT authentication
- Backend → Database: MongoDB queries with connection pooling
- Backend → AI: Subprocess execution for try-on processing
- Frontend ← Backend: Real-time status updates via polling

## System Qualities

**Scalability:** Modular architecture with reusable components, database indexing, and asynchronous background processing support concurrent users independently.

**Performance:** Non-blocking AI processing keeps servers responsive with optimized image handling and fast database queries through intelligent indexing.

**Reliability:** Graceful error handling, automatic cleanup tasks, session validation, and comprehensive logging ensure stable operations.

**Security:** JWT authentication with bcrypt hashing, single-session enforcement, protected endpoints, and secure transaction verification.

**Maintainability:** Layered service architecture (routes → controllers → services → database) with clear separation of concerns.

**Responsiveness:** Real-time job polling, immediate UI feedback, and non-blocking responses during processing.

## Authentication System

**JWT-Based Security**
The platform uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication. Each user receives a token upon login with automatic expiration and must include it in subsequent requests.

**Single-Session Enforcement**
Only one active login session per user is permitted. When a user logs in, all previous JWT tokens are invalidated — previously logged-in devices automatically lose access. The frontend detects invalid tokens and redirects to login. Session metadata (IP address, user agent) is tracked for security audits.

**Protected Routes**
All protected endpoints require valid, non-expired JWT tokens, active user accounts, and full profile registration (photo + gender preference). Backend validates session integrity on every request through token verification, expiration checks, and account status confirmation.

---

## AI Processing Workflow

**Asynchronous Design**
The platform uses background processing to keep servers responsive during intensive AI workloads:

1. User submits try-on or recommendation request via API
2. Backend creates processing job with unique ID
3. Asynchronous task spawns in background without blocking server
4. Server responds immediately with job ID and status
5. Backend continues handling other requests without interruption

**Processing Isolation:** AI tasks run in isolated threads/subprocesses with multiple jobs processing concurrently. Failed tasks don't impact server stability.

**Status Polling:** Frontend polls job status at regular intervals. Backend returns current status (pending, processing, completed, failed). Frontend receives live updates and stops polling automatically upon completion.

**Why This Matters:** Servers remain responsive during intensive computation. Multiple users can submit requests simultaneously. Better resource utilization with background processing. Improved user experience with immediate feedback.

## Wardrobe System

Each user maintains a personal digital wardrobe with upload, organization, and retrieval capabilities.

**Features:**
- Upload items with category classification (tops, bottoms, dresses, etc.)
- Automatic image optimization and compression for storage efficiency
- Unique file paths with user and item identifiers
- Metadata storage with timestamps and status flags
- Soft-delete support (active/inactive status)

**Performance:**
- Fast retrieval by category for recommendations
- Indexed queries for quick access
- Item embeddings for visual matching
- Status filtering for efficient data management

---

## Recommendation System

The engine analyzes user wardrobes to suggest compatible outfit combinations:

1. User selects item or requests recommendations
2. Backend analyzes characteristics and wardrobe inventory
3. AI algorithm identifies compatible top/bottom pairings
4. System returns ranked candidates with confidence scores
5. Frontend displays visual previews

**Recommendation Types:**
- **Top Recommendations:** Tops matching bottoms or outfit style
- **Bottom Recommendations:** Bottoms compatible with selected tops
- **Outfit Combinations:** Smart pairings from existing wardrobe

Results include visual previews, multiple ranked candidates, style-aware matching, and confidence scores for user decision-making.

## Subscription System

Premium access is controlled through subscription plans with credit-based quotas.

**Plan Structure:**
- Multiple tier options (Starter, Pro, Premium)
- Credit allocation per plan
- Monthly or custom billing cycles
- Feature-based access control

**Credit System:**
- Try-on generation: 5 credits per action
- Recommendations: 3 credits per action
- Registration bonus: 50 credits for new users
- Credits deducted automatically on usage

**Payment Integration:**
Razorpay payment gateway handles secure order creation and verification. Payment status is tracked in the database with automatic plan activation upon success and full transaction history.

**Quota Management:**
Real-time credit balance tracking, insufficient credit prevention, and plan renewal/upgrade options.

---

## Performance & Scalability

**Modular Architecture:**
Independent route handlers for each feature, service layer abstraction for reusable logic, controller-based request handling, and database abstraction for consistency.

**Frontend Optimization:**
Reusable React components reduce code duplication, Context API provides efficient state management, images use lazy loading, and Tailwind CSS keeps bundle sizes small with utility-first styling.

**Backend Optimization:**
Connection pooling for database queries, indexes on frequently queried fields, async/await patterns for non-blocking I/O, efficient middleware logging, and background cleanup of temporary files.

**Scaling Strategies:**
Asynchronous job processing supports concurrent operations. Modular services can be moved to separate servers if needed. Database indexing enables efficient queries at scale. Horizontal scaling is possible through load balancing. GPU resources for AI can be upgraded independently.

---

## Security Features

**Authentication:** JWT tokens with cryptographic signatures, bcrypt password hashing, token expiration enforcement, and secure transmission.

**Session Management:** Single-session enforcement prevents hijacking. Previous sessions auto-invalidate. Session metadata validates integrity.

**API Security:** Protected endpoints require valid authentication. User isolation ensures data access control. Input validation on all endpoints with CORS configuration.

**Data Protection:** Database connection encryption, secure file upload validation, protected media endpoints, and automatic cleanup of sensitive temporary files.

**Admin Protection:** Separate admin authentication, protected admin routes, action logging, and limited account creation via secret key.
